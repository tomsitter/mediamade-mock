        <h2>Testimonials</h2>
        <blockquote>"First off, location, location, location!  The Landon Hotel in Vienna is located in a wonderfully picturesque part of town.  The staff were polite and friendly, and the neighborhood really did feel welcoming.  I even ended up extending my stay, and the hotel staff made all the arrangements!  Can't wait to make my way out to the Landon in Vienna again." <cite>Donald Platameyer, New York</cite></blockquote>

        <blockquote>"On my recent visit to Paris, I decided to stay in the Landon Hotel while visiting a friend.  The hotel was quite lovely and the location made it very easy to meet up with my friend.  Also, the room was spacious and the bed was unusually comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!" <cite>Amy Xhou, Los Angeles</cite></blockquote>

        <blockquote>"A few friends and I stayed at the Landon hotel in London last month and we had a very memorable visit.  The hotel is located close to public transportation, which made it easy for us to get around the city.  We loved people-watching from the rooftop restaurant, and shared many laughs and wonderful food.  The rooms were luxurious, to say the least, and the staff catered to our every whim.  We’ll certainly be back." <cite>Jonathan Pierre Rousseau, Paris</cite></blockquote>
